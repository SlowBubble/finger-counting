Build a math game using index.html and main.js using a header and a canvas
- In the header, render "Press space"
- When the user press space
    - Pick 2 random numbers between 0 and 5, say n1 and n2
    - Ask "I have $n1 fingers on the left and $n2 fingers on the right. How many fingers are there?"
    - In the header, render "$n1 + $n2"
    - In the canvas, render n1 fingers on the left and n2 fingers on the right
      - The drawing can be very simple, just thin rectangles sticking out of the bottom capped by circles, and color in the skin and nails.
- When the user press numbers, handle it similar to how things are handled in old.js (but using the header instead of the canvas)
